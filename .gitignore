# Whitelist approach: ignore everything, then explicitly track persistent files

# Ignore everything by default
*

# Track persistent workspace structure
!.gitignore
!.cursorrules
!README.md

# Track persistent directories (and their contents)
!tools/
!tools/**
!templates/
!templates/**

# Keep work/ directory structure but ignore contents
!work/
!work/.keep
