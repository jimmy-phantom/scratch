# Cursor Rules

A persistent shell for ad-hoc projects, using git branches to isolate work.

## Core Rule
All generated files go in `work/` unless explicitly told otherwise.

## Directory Structure

**`work/`** — Project workspace (read/write)
- All generated files, experiments, prototypes, and temporary output go here
- Safe to overwrite anything here at any time
- Contents are tracked by git and isolated per-branch

**`tools/`** — Persistent utility scripts (read only)
- Helper scripts and automation tools
- Modify only when explicitly requested

**`templates/`** — Reusable scaffolds (read only)
- Reference examples and starting points
- When using a template, create the result in `work/`

**`./` (root)** — Workspace configuration (read only)
- Persistent files that define workspace behavior
- Includes .cursorrules, README, .gitignore

## Actions Requiring Explicit Permission
- Modify files outside `work/`
- Delete any file
- Create files in root, tools, or templates
- Initialize git, package managers, or build systems

## Protected
- `.keep` files: never delete (preserve empty directories in version control)
- `.cursorrules`, `tools/*`, `templates/*`: modify only when explicitly requested

## Defaults
- Ambiguous location → use `work/`
- Conflict with these rules → follow the rules unless user explicitly overrides
- Unsure about modifying → ask first
